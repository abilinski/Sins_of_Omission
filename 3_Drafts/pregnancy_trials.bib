The Task Force for the Elimination of Perinatal HIV Transmission in the United States, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has identified the monitoring of ARV safety as a paramount concern in the ongoing mission to eliminate perinatal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. As active members of this task force, we urge all healthcare providers who care for pregnant individuals to prioritize reporting all ARV exposures to the registry., The Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry is an international, voluntary registry that prospectively gathers data on antiretroviral exposure. Despite its importance, only a minority of providers use the registry, resulting in significant gaps in critical information needed to guide prescribing practices during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Our aim was to project the outcomes of using either efavirenz or nevirapine as part of initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) in women of childbearing age in Côte d’Ivoire.

Methods
We used an HIV computer simulation model to project both the mother’s survival and the birth defects at 10 years for a cohort of women who started ART with either efavirenz or nevirapine. The primary outcome was the ratio at 10 years of the difference in the number of women alive to the difference in the cumulative number of birth defects in women who started ART with efavirenz compared to nevirapine. In the base case analysis, the birth defect rate was 2.9\% on efavirenz and 2.7\% on nevirapine. In sensitivity analyses we varied all inputs across confidence intervals reported in the literature.

Results
In the base case analysis, for a cohort of 100,000 women, the additional number of women alive initiating ART with efavirenz at 10 years was 15 times the additional number of birth defects (women alive: nevirapine 67,969, efavirenz 68,880, difference = 911; birth defects: nevirapine 1,128, efavirenz 1,187, difference = 59). In sensitivity analysis, the teratogenicity rate with efavirenz had to be 6.3\%, or 2.3 times higher than the rate with nevirapine, for the excess number of birth defects to outweigh the additional number of women alive at 10 years.

Conclusions
In Côte d’Ivoire, initiating ART with efavirenz instead of nevirapine is likely to substantially increase the number of women alive at 10 years with a smaller potential number of birth defects.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Evidence-informed priority setting, in particular cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), can help target resources better to achieve universal health coverage. Central to the application of CEA is the use of a cost-effectiveness threshold. We add to the literature by looking at what thresholds have been used in published CEA and the proportion of interventions found to be cost-effective, by type of threshold.
Methods
We identified CEA studies in low- and middle-income countries from the Global Health Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry that were published between January 1, 2015, and January 6, 2020. We extracted data on the country of focus, type of interventions under consideration, funder, threshold used, and recommendations.
Results
A total of 230 studies with a total 713 interventions were included in this review; 1 to 3× gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was the most common type of threshold used in judging cost-effectiveness (84.3\%). Approximately a third of studies (34.2\%) using 1 to 3× GDP per capita applied a threshold at 3× GDP per capita. We have found that no study used locally developed thresholds. We found that 79.3\% of interventions received a recommendation as “cost-effective” and that 85.9\% of studies had at least 1 intervention that was considered cost-effective. The use of 1 to 3× GDP per capita led to a higher proportion of study interventions being judged as cost-effective compared with other types of thresholds.
Conclusions
Despite the wide concerns about the use of 1 to 3× GDP per capita, this threshold is still widely used in the literature. Using this threshold leads to more interventions being recommended as “cost-effective.” This study further explore alternatives to the 1 to 3× GDP as a decision rule.},

	abstract = {Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi–Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi–Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14–20 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11–17 percentage points with 5\% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios–Ipsos online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition.},

	abstract = {The US COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) is a large, cross-sectional, internet-based survey that has operated continuously since April 6, 2020. By inviting a random sample of Facebook active users each day, CTIS collects information about COVID-19 symptoms, risks, mitigating behaviors, mental health, testing, vaccination, and other key priorities. The large scale of the survey—over 20 million responses in its first year of operation—allows tracking of trends over short timescales and allows comparisons at fine demographic and geographic detail. The survey has been repeatedly revised to respond to emerging public health priorities. In this paper, we describe the survey methods and content and give examples of CTIS results that illuminate key patterns and trends and help answer high-priority policy questions relevant to the COVID-19 epidemic and response. These results demonstrate how large online surveys can provide continuous, real-time indicators of important outcomes that are not subject to public health reporting delays and backlogs. The CTIS offers high value as a supplement to official reporting data by supplying essential information about behaviors, attitudes toward policy and preventive measures, economic impacts, and other topics not reported in public health surveillance systems.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0151586},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Folate-sensitive neural tube defects (NTDs) are an important, preventable cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need to describe the current global burden of NTDs and identify gaps in available NTD data.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and searched multiple databases for NTD prevalence estimates and abstracted data from peer-reviewed literature, birth defects surveillance registries, and reports published between January 1990 and July 2014 that had greater than 5,000 births and were not solely based on mortality data. We classified countries according to World Health Organization (WHO) regions and World Bank income classifications. The initial search yielded 11,614 results; after systematic review we identified 160 full text manuscripts and reports that met the inclusion criteria. Data came from 75 countries. Coverage by WHO region varied in completeness (i.e., \% of countries reporting) as follows: African (17\%), Eastern Mediterranean (57\%), European (49\%), Americas (43\%), South-East Asian (36\%), and Western Pacific (33\%). The reported NTD prevalence ranges and medians for each region were: African (5.2-75.4; 11.7 per 10,000 births), Eastern Mediterranean (2.1-124.1; 21.9 per 10,000 births), European (1.3-35.9; 9.0 per 10,000 births), Americas (3.3-27.9; 11.5 per 10,000 births), South-East Asian (1.9-66.2; 15.8 per 10,000 births), and Western Pacific (0.3-199.4; 6.9 per 10,000 births). The presence of a registry or surveillance system for NTDs increased with country income level: low income (0\%), lower-middle income (25\%), upper-middle income (70\%), and high income (91\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Many WHO member states (120/194) did not have any data on NTD prevalence. Where data are collected, prevalence estimates vary widely. These findings highlight the need for greater NTD surveillance efforts, especially in lower-income countries. NTDs are an important public health problem that can be prevented with folic acid supplementation and fortification of staple foods.},

	abstract = {Population-level data on COVID-19 vaccine uptake in pregnancy and SARS-CoV-2 infection outcomes are lacking. We describe COVID-19 vaccine uptake and SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women in Scotland, using whole-population data from a national, prospective cohort. Between the start of a COVID-19 vaccine program in Scotland, on 8 December 2020 and 31 October 2021, 25,917 COVID-19 vaccinations were given to 18,457 pregnant women. Vaccine coverage was substantially lower in pregnant women than in the general female population of 18−44 years; 32.3\% of women giving birth in October 2021 had two doses of vaccine compared to 77.4\% in all women. The extended perinatal mortality rate for women who gave birth within 28 d of a COVID-19 diagnosis was 22.6 per 1,000 births (95\% CI 12.9−38.5; pandemic background rate 5.6 per 1,000 births; 452 out of 80,456; 95\% CI 5.1−6.2). Overall, 77.4\% (3,833 out of 4,950; 95\% CI 76.2−78.6) of SARS-CoV-2 infections, 90.9\% (748 out of 823; 95\% CI 88.7−92.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with hospital admission and 98\% (102 out of 104; 95\% CI 92.5−99.7) of SARS-CoV-2 associated with critical care admission, as well as all baby deaths, occurred in pregnant women who were unvaccinated at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Addressing low vaccine uptake rates in pregnant women is imperative to protect the health of women and babies in the ongoing pandemic.},

With limited ability to contain the virus and relatively high transmissibility and case fatality rates, governmental institutions and pharmaceutical companies are racing to find therapeutics and vaccines that target this novel coronavirus. However, once again, pregnant and breastfeeding women are excluded from participating in clinical trials during this pandemic. This “protection by exclusion” of pregnant women from drug development and clinical therapeutic trials, even during epidemics and pandemics, is not unprecedented. Moreover, it is both misguided and not justifiable and may have excluded them from potentially beneficial interventions. This is another missed opportunity to obtain pregnancy-specific safety and efficacy data, because therapeutics developed for men and nonpregnant women may not be generalizable to pregnant women. Therefore, we recommend and urge the scientific community and professional societies that, without clear justification for exclusion, pregnant women should be given the opportunity to be included in clinical trials for COVID-19 based on the concepts of justice, equity, autonomy, and informed consent.},

Estimating the costs of this evidence of efficacy provides an important perspective.To estimate costs and assess scientific characteristics of pivotal efficacy trials that supported the approval of new therapeutic agents by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from 2015 to 2016.This study identified 59 novel therapeutic drugs using the annual summary reports from the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ClinicalTrials.gov, FDA reviews, and peer-reviewed publications that were publicly available in 2017 were used to identify 52 characteristics of each efficacy trial. Costs were calculated with a global clinical trial cost assessment tool available to contract research organizations and pharmaceutical sponsors.Estimated mean cost and 95\% CIs based on industry benchmark data from 60 countries. Measures of trials’ scientific characteristics included trial design (no control group, placebo, and active drug), end point (surrogate outcome, clinical scale, and clinical outcome), patient enrollment, and treatment duration.A total of 138 pivotal clinical trials provided the basis for approval of 59 new therapeutic agents by the FDA from 2015 to 2016, with a median estimated cost of \$19.0 million (interquartile range, \$12.2 million-\$33.1 million). Estimated costs ranged from less than \$5 million for trials without a control group for 3 orphan drugs with fewer than 15 patients each to \$346.8 million (95\% CI, \$252.0 million-\$441.5 million) for a noninferiority trial with end points assessing clinical benefit. Twenty-six of 138 trials (18.8\%) were uncontrolled, with a mean estimated cost of \$13.5 million (95\% CI, \$10.1 million-\$16.9 million). Trials designed with placebo or active drug comparators had an estimated mean cost of \$35.1 million (95\% CI, \$25.4 million-\$44.8 million). Costs also varied by trial end point, treatment duration, patient enrollment, and therapeutic area.The highest-cost trials were those in which the new agent had to be proved to be noninferior with clinical benefit end points compared with an agent already available or those that required larger patient populations to achieve statistical power to document smaller treatment effects or accrue infrequently occurring end points.},

The estimated average out-of-pocket cost per approved new compound is \$1395 million (2013 dollars). Capitalizing out-of-pocket costs to the point of marketing approval at a real discount rate of 10.5\% yields a total pre-approval cost estimate of \$2558 million (2013 dollars). When compared to the results of the previous study in this series, total capitalized costs were shown to have increased at an annual rate of 8.5\% above general price inflation.

What is known about the safety of the HPV vaccine during pregnancy?, Answer The HPV vaccine is generally not recommended for use in pregnant women. However, theoretically, because it is not a live vaccine, it is not expected to be associated with an increased risk. Also, information from the manufacturer’s pregnancy registry and phase 3 clinical trials does not indicate an increased risk of fetal malformations or other adverse effects due to the vaccine.},

	abstract = {Objectives
The purpose of this study was to compare and determine whether there were any differences in clinical outcomes between pregnant and non-pregnant women who had been infected with COVID-19.

Methods
A literature search was performed in 9 databases on November 20, 2021. The relative risk (RR) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) was used to estimate the effect of pregnancy on COVID-19 outcomes. The I square value was used to assess heterogeneity, and the random or the fixed-effects model were adopted. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed.

Results
This study included 8 published studies with 859,278 COVID-19 female patients. The incidences of fever and cough among pregnant women with COVID-19 were 19.07\% and 28.79\%, respectively. Pregnancy was associated with significantly increased risks of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 2.23, 95\% CI = 1.58–3.16) and ventilation (RR = 2.13, 95\% CI = 1.06–4.28), but was not associated with a statistically significant increase in mortality.

Conclusions
Our results suggest that pregnant women with COVID-19 have a significantly higher probability of being hospitalized to the ICU and ventilation than non-pregnant women with COVID-19. To avoid these adverse outcomes, pregnant women should take precautions (for example, reduce going out, maintain social distance, and wear a mask) to avoid COVID-19 infection. Finally, additional research into the fetal outcomes is required to better investigate the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy.},

Design Prospective national population based cohort study using the UK Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS).
Setting All 194 obstetric units in the UK.
Participants 427 pregnant women admitted to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1 March 2020 and 14 April 2020.
Main outcome measures Incidence of maternal hospital admission and infant infection. Rates of maternal death, level 3 critical care unit admission, fetal loss, caesarean birth, preterm birth, stillbirth, early neonatal death, and neonatal unit admission.
Results The estimated incidence of admission to hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was 4.9 (95\% confidence interval 4.5 to 5.4) per 1000 maternities. 233 (56\%) pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy were from black or other ethnic minority groups, 281 (69\%) were overweight or obese, 175 (41\%) were aged 35 or over, and 145 (34\%) had pre-existing comorbidities. 266 (62\%) women gave birth or had a pregnancy loss; 196 (73\%) gave birth at term. Forty one (10\%) women admitted to hospital needed respiratory support, and five (1\%) women died. Twelve (5\%) of 265 infants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, six of them within the first 12 hours after birth.
Conclusions Most pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection were in the late second or third trimester, supporting guidance for continued social distancing measures in later pregnancy. Most had good outcomes, and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to infants was uncommon. The high proportion of women from black or minority ethnic groups admitted with infection needs urgent investigation and explanation.

	abstract = {Background
Despite 2.5 million infections and 169,000 deaths worldwide (as of April 20, 2020), no maternal deaths and only a few pregnant women afflicted with severe respiratory morbidity have been reported to be related to COVID-19 disease. Given the disproportionate burden of severe and fatal respiratory disease previously documented among pregnant women following other coronavirus-related outbreaks (SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012) and influenza pandemics over the last century, the absence of reported maternal morbidity and mortality with COVID-19 disease is unexpected.
Objective
To describe maternal and perinatal outcomes and death in a case series of pregnant women with COVID-19 disease.
Study Design
We describe here a multiinstitution adjudicated case series from Iran that includes 9 pregnant women diagnosed with severe COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester. All 9 pregnant women received a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction nucleic acid testing. Outcomes of these women were compared with their familial/household members with contact to the affected patient on or after their symptom onset. All data were reported at death or after a minimum of 14 days from date of admission with COVID-19 disease.
Results
Among 9 pregnant women with severe COVID-19 disease, at the time of reporting, 7 of 9 died, 1 of 9 remains critically ill and ventilator dependent, and 1 of 9 recovered after prolonged hospitalization. We obtained self-verified familial/household cohort data in all 9 cases, and in each and every instance, maternal outcomes were more severe compared with outcomes of other high- and low-risk familial/household members (n=33 members for comparison).
Conclusion
We report herein maternal deaths owing to COVID-19 disease. Until rigorously collected surveillance data emerge, it is prudent to be aware of the potential for maternal death among pregnant women diagnosed as having COVID-19 disease in their second or third trimester.},

	abstract = {The emergence of a novel coronavirus, termed SARS-CoV-2, and the potentially life-threatening respiratory disease that it can produce, COVID-19, has rapidly spread across the globe, creating a massive public health problem. Previous epidemics of many emerging viral infections have typically resulted in poor obstetric outcomes including maternal morbidity and mortality, maternal-fetal transmission of the virus, and perinatal infections and death. This article reviews the effects of 2 previous coronavirus infections-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV-on pregnancy outcomes. In addition, it analyzes literature describing 38 pregnant women with COVID-19 and their newborns in China to assess the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the mothers and infants, including clinical, laboratory, and virologic data, and the transmissibility of the virus from mother to fetus. This analysis reveals that unlike coronavirus infections of pregnant women caused by SARS and MERS, in these 38 pregnant women COVID-19 did not lead to maternal deaths. Importantly, and similar to pregnancies with SARS and MERS, there were no confirmed cases of intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from mothers with COVID-19 to their fetuses. All neonatal specimens tested, including placentas in some cases, were negative by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. At this point in the global pandemic of COVID-19 infection there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes intrauterine or transplacental transmission from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Analysis of additional cases is necessary to determine if this remains true.},

	abstract = {Detailed information about the association of COVID-19 with outcomes in pregnant individuals compared with not-infected pregnant individuals is much needed.To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals.In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias.  Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge.COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms.The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity.A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6\%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2\%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95\% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95\% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95\% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95\% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95\% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95\% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95\% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95\% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95\% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95\% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95\% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1\% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13\%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95\% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95\% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity.In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.},

	abstract = {Objective
We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the available literature to determine the effects of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in pregnant women from the foetal perspective by estimation of mother to child transmission, perinatal outcome and possible teratogenicity.

Methods
Data sources: eligible studies between 1 November 2019 and 10 August 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, LitCovid, Google Scholar, EBSCO MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, MedRXiv, BioRXiv and Scopus collection databases. English language case reports, case series and cohort studies of SARS-CoV-2 confirmed pregnant women with data on perinatal outcome, congenital anomalies and mother to child transmission were analysed.

Results
38 case reports, 34 cohort and case series describing 1408 neonates were included for evidence acquisition of mother to child transmission. 29 case reports and 31 case series and cohort studies describing 1318 foetuses were included for the evaluation of perinatal outcome and congenital anomalies. A pooled proportion of 3.67\% neonates had positive SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA nasopharyngeal swab results and 7.1\% had positive cord blood samples. 11.7\% of the placenta, 6.8\% of amniotic fluid, 9.6\% of faecal and rectal swabs and none of the urine samples were positive. The rate of preterm labour was 26.4\% (OR=1.45, 95\% CI 1.03 to 2.03 with p=0.03) and caesarean delivery (CS) was 59.9\% (OR=1.54, 95\% CI 1.17 to 2.03 with p=0.002). The most common neonatal symptom was breathing difficulty (1.79\%). Stillbirth rate was 9.9 per 1000 total births in babies born to COVID-19 mothers.

Conclusion
Chances of mother to child transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is low. The perinatal outcome for the foetus is favourable. There is increased chances of CS but not preterm delivery. The stillbirth and neonatal death rates are low. There are no reported congenital anomalies in babies born to SARS CoV-2 positive mothers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir could have a major role in future antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in sub-Saharan Africa because of its high potency and barrier to resistance, good tolerability, and low cost, but there is uncertainty over appropriate policies for use relating to the potential for drug resistance spread and a possible increased risk of neural tube defects in infants if used in women at the time of conception. We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission, progression, and the effect of ART with the aim of informing policy makers on approaches to the use of dolutegravir that are likely to lead to the highest population health gains.
METHODS: We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults, which takes into account the effects of drug resistance and differential drug potency in determining viral suppression and clinical outcomes to compare predicted outcomes of alternative ART regimen policies. We calculated disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) for each policy, assuming that a woman having a child with a neural tube defect incurs an extra DALY per year for the remainder of the time horizon and accounting for mother-to-child transmission. We used a 20 year time horizon, a 3\% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US\$500 per DALY averted.
FINDINGS: The greatest number of DALYs is predicted to be averted with use of a policy in which tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir is used in all people on ART, including switching to tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir in those currently on ART, regardless of current viral load suppression and intention to have (more) children. This result was consistent in several sensitivity analyses. We predict that this policy would be cost-saving.
INTERPRETATION: Using a standard DALY framework to compare health outcomes from a public health perspective, the benefits of transition to tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir for all substantially outweighed the risks.

	doi = {10.7326/M21-3037},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transition to dolutegravir-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART) in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) was complicated by an initial safety signal in May 2018 suggesting that exposure to dolutegravir at conception was possibly associated with infant neural tube defects. On the basis of additional evidence, in July 2019, the World Health Organization recommended dolutegravir for all adults and adolescents living with HIV.
OBJECTIVE: To describe dolutegravir uptake and disparities by sex and age group in LMICs.
DESIGN: Observational cohort study.
SETTING: 87 sites that began using dolutegravir in 11 LMICs in the Asia-Pacific; Caribbean, Central and South America network for HIV epidemiology (CCASAnet); and sub-Saharan African regions of the International epidemiology Databases to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) consortium.
PATIENTS: 134 672 patients aged 16 years or older who received HIV care from January 2017 through March 2020.
MEASUREMENTS: Sex, age group, and dolutegravir uptake (that is, newly initiating ART with dolutegravir or switching to dolutegravir from another regimen).
RESULTS: Differences in dolutegravir uptake among females of reproductive age (16 to 49 years) emerged after the safety signal. By the end of follow-up, the cumulative incidence of dolutegravir uptake among females 16 to 49 years old was 29.4\% (95\% CI, 29.0\% to 29.7\%) compared with 57.7\% (CI, 57.2\% to 58.3\%) among males 16 to 49 years old. This disparity was greater in countries that began implementing dolutegravir before the safety signal and initially had highly restrictive policies versus countries with a later rollout. Dolutegravir uptake was similar among females and males aged 50 years or older.
LIMITATION: Follow-up was limited to 6 to 8 months after international guidelines recommended expanding access to dolutegravir.
CONCLUSION: Substantial disparities in dolutegravir uptake affecting females of reproductive age through early 2020 are documented. Although this disparity was anticipated because of country-level restrictions on access, the results highlight its extent and initial persistence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir could have a major role in future antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens in sub-Saharan Africa because of its high potency and barrier to resistance, good tolerability, and low cost, but there is uncertainty over appropriate policies for use relating to the potential for drug resistance spread and a possible increased risk of neural tube defects in infants if used in women at the time of conception. We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission, progression, and the effect of ART with the aim of informing policy makers on approaches to the use of dolutegravir that are likely to lead to the highest population health gains.
METHODS: We used an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults, which takes into account the effects of drug resistance and differential drug potency in determining viral suppression and clinical outcomes to compare predicted outcomes of alternative ART regimen policies. We calculated disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) for each policy, assuming that a woman having a child with a neural tube defect incurs an extra DALY per year for the remainder of the time horizon and accounting for mother-to-child transmission. We used a 20 year time horizon, a 3\% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US\$500 per DALY averted.

	abstract = {Introduction The unexpected identification of a neural tube defect (NTD) safety signal with preconception dolutegravir (DTG) exposure in the Botswana Tsepamo birth outcomes study brought into sharp focus the need for reliable data on use of new antiretrovirals in pregnancy, improved pharmacovigilance systems to evaluate safety of new drugs being introduced into populations including women of reproductive potential, and balanced risk-benefit messaging when a safety signal is identified. Discussion The Tsepamo study NTD safety signal and accompanying regulatory responses led to uncertainty about the most appropriate approach to DTG use among women of reproductive potential, affecting global DTG roll-out plans, and limiting DTG use in adolescent girls and women. It also revealed a tension between a public health approach to antiretroviral treatment (ART) and individual choice, and highlighted difficulties interpreting and messaging an unexpected safety signal with uncertainty about risk. This difficulty was compounded by the lack of high-quality data on pregnancy outcomes from women receiving ART outside the Tsepamo surveillance sites and countries other than Botswana, resulting in a prolonged period of uncertainty while data on additional exposures are evaluated to refute or confirm the initial safety signal. We discuss principles for evaluating and introducing new drugs in the general population that would ensure collection of appropriate data to inform drug safety in adolescent girls and women of reproductive potential and minimize confusion about drug use in this population when a safety signal is identified. Conclusions The response to a signal suggesting a possible safety risk for a drug used in pregnancy or among women who may become pregnant needs to be rapid and comprehensive. It requires the existence of appropriately designed surveillance systems with broad population coverage; data analyses that examine risk-benefit trade-offs in a variety of contexts; guidance to transform this risk-benefit balance into effective and agreed-upon policy; involvement of the affected community and other key stakeholders; and a communication plan for all levels of knowledge and complexity. Implementation of this proposed framework for responding to safety signals is needed to ensure that any drug used in pregnancy can be rapidly and appropriately evaluated should a serious safety alert arise.},

	abstract = {Introduction Historical approaches to clinical development of novel therapeutics for treatment and prevention of HIV have led to unacceptable delays in the generation of data to support optimal antiretroviral drug use in pregnancy. Over the last 5 years, multiple stakeholders have voiced their concerns around the exclusion of pregnant women from drug trials, and some progress has been made to consolidate principles and forge consensus. Building on ongoing efforts, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Maternal Paediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network (IMPAACT) convened a technical consultation designed to move the discussion from theory to practice. Discussion Accelerating the inclusion of pregnant women in pre-licensure clinical trials, with a goal to have pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary safety data for all new HIV agents in pregnancy available at the time of drug approval, requires: (1) performing non-clinical developmental and reproductive toxicology studies early in drug development for all new HIV agents; (2) recognizing and acting on the central role of women of childbearing potential affected by HIV through the research being conducted and the dissemination of associated results; (3) enrolling pregnant women in studies to specifically determine pregnancy PK and preliminary safety, as soon as late non-clinical studies are completed with no negative signals, for all new HIV agents that have demonstrated preliminary evidence of safety and efficacy from phase 2 trials; (4) investigating adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes through dedicated pregnancy safety studies for all new priority HIV agents; and (5) expanding active surveillance of drug safety in pregnancy for rare events, such as birth defects. Strategic actions to pursue include developing tools and resources to support designing and implementing studies among pregnant and breastfeeding women, identifying and promoting modifications of the regulatory framework that are supportive of systematic ethical investigation of new drugs in pregnancy, coordinating surveillance efforts, mobilizing key stakeholders and promoting transparency and accountability for all involved. Conclusions With more than 19 million women living with HIV worldwide, ensuring greater inclusion of pregnant women in research on novel therapeutics is a priority to support drug optimization and effective introduction of innovations for treatment and prevention of HIV.},

Discussion Completing all DART studies prior to or early during the conduct of phase 3 trials (i.e. earlier than current common practice) can accelerate and facilitate the inclusion of women who become pregnant during pre-licensure trials to remain on study drug and to potentially enrol pregnant women more rapidly. Promoting complementary strategies, such as alternative combinations of DART study designs and physiologically based pharmacokinetic modelling, could better inform drug dosing and safety in pregnancy at an earlier stage in drug development. The interpretation of the results of non-clinical DART studies is often complex. Institutional review boards/ethics committees should have access to relevant expertise for interpretation and application of results of non-clinical developmental and reproductive toxicity studies. Clear communication and thorough understanding of non-clinical findings and the overall benefit–risk profile of the product are critical to review protocols and determine if women who become pregnant during a clinical trial could continue on study drug and/or to enrol pregnant women in the trial. The informed consent document should be well written so that participants can make an informed decision to stay on study drug or participate in a trial during pregnancy. Ultimately, the decision to allow women who become pregnant during pre-licensure trials to remain on study will depend on the totality of the evidence and benefit–risk considerations. Conclusions We propose that industry completes non-clinical reproductive toxicity studies prior to or early during the conduct of phase 3 trials in HIV drug development, especially for priority agents, and potentially uses alternative DART study design strategies to achieve this goal.},

Discussion The World Health Organization and International Maternal, Pediatric, Adolescent Antiretroviral Clinical Trials Network convened a year-long workshop on “Approaches to Enhance and Accelerate Study of New Drugs for HIV and Associated Infections in Pregnant Women.” Workshop participants were tasked with defining key principles and optimal approaches to including pregnant women in pre- and post-licensure trials in order to accelerate the availability of pharmacokinetic and safety data for new ARV agents in pregnancy. ARV efficacy in pregnancy and ARV efficacy for prevention of vertical transmission can be extrapolated from proof of efficacy in non-pregnant adults, provided that drug levels in pregnancy are similar. However, short-term safety and pharmacokinetics must be studied directly in pregnant women and should be conducted and included in initial licensure for all new ARVs. Accelerating the timeline for completion of pre-clinical studies is essential for pregnancy short-term safety and pharmacokinetic studies to be safely completed by the time a drug is licensed. Composite key pregnancy, birth and neonatal outcomes are critical for drugs expected to have broad use, and studies should be initiated at or soon after drug licensure. Teratogenicity risk cannot be feasibly assessed before drug licensure and will depend on robust post-marketing surveillance systems. With some modifications, these principles will apply to ARVs used for prevention, two-drug regimens, long-acting ARVs and ARVs administered through novel delivery systems. Conclusions Implementation of the proposed principles and framework will enhance and accelerate the study of new ARVs in pregnancy, resulting in more timely, equitable and informed access to new ARVs for pregnant women.},

	abstract = {Introduction Pregnant women are routinely excluded from clinical trials, leading to the absence or delay in even the most basic pharmacokinetic (PK) information needed for dosing in pregnancy. When available, pregnancy PK studies use a small sample size, resulting in limited safety information. We discuss key study design elements that may enhance the timely availability of pregnancy data, including the role and timing of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate pregnancy safety; efficacy and safety outcome measures; stand-alone protocols, platform trials, single arm studies, sample size and the effect that follow-up time during gestation has on analysis interpretations; and observational studies. Discussion Pregnancy PK should be studied during drug development, after dosing in non-pregnant persons is established (unless non-clinical or other data raise pregnancy concerns). RCTs should evaluate the safety during pregnancy of priority new HIV agents that are likely to be used by large numbers of females of childbearing age. Key endpoints for pregnancy safety studies include birth outcomes (prematurity, small for gestational age and stillbirth) and neonatal death, with traditional adverse events and infant growth also measured (congenital anomalies are best studied through surveillance). We recommend that viral efficacy be studied as a secondary endpoint of pregnancy RCTs, once PK studies confirm adequate drug exposure in pregnancy. RCTs typically use a stand-alone protocol for new agents. In contrast, master protocols using a platform design can add agents over time, possibly speeding safety data ascertainment. To speed accrual, stand-alone pregnancy trial protocols can include pre-specified starting rules based upon adequate PK levels in pregnancy; and seamless master protocols or platform trials can include a pregnancy PK and safety component. When RCTs are unethical or cost-prohibitive, observational studies should be conducted, preferably using target trial emulation to avoid bias. Conclusions Pregnancy PK needs to be obtained earlier in drug evaluation. Timely RCTs are needed to understand safety in pregnancy for high-priority new HIV agents. RCTs that enrol pregnant women should focus on outcomes unique to pregnancy, and observational studies should focus on questions that RCTs are not equipped to answer.},

	abstract = {Introduction As new antiretrovirals (ARVs), including long-acting ARVs for treatment and prevention, are approved and introduced, surveillance during pregnancy must become the safety net for evaluating birth outcomes, especially those that are rare and require large numbers of observations. Historically, drug pharmacovigilance in pregnancy has been limited and fragmented between different data sources, resulting in inadequate data to assess risk. The International Maternal Pediatric Adolescent AIDS Clinical Trials Network and World Health Organization convened a Workshop which reviewed strengths and weaknesses of existing programs and discussed an improved framework to integrate existing safety data sources and promote harmonization and digitalization. Discussion This paper highlights that although robust sources of safety data and surveillance programs exist, key challenges remain, including unknown denominators, reporting bias, under-reporting (e.g. in voluntary registries), few data sources from resource-limited settings (most are in North America and Europe), incomplete or inaccurate data (e.g. within routine medical records). However, recent experiences (e.g. with safety signals) and current innovations (e.g. electronic record use in resource-limited settings and defining adverse outcomes) provide momentum and building blocks for a new framework for active surveillance of ARV safety in pregnancy. A public health approach should be taken using data from existing sources, including registries of pregnancy ARV exposure and birth defects; observational surveillance and cohort studies; clinical trials; and real-world databases. Key facilitators are harmonization and standardization of outcomes, sharing of materials and tools, and data linkages between programs. Other key facilitators include the development of guidance to estimate sample size and duration of surveillance, ensuring strategic geographic diversity, bringing partners together to share information and engaging the community of women living with HIV. Conclusions Looking ahead, critical steps to safely introduce new ARVs include (1) adopting harmonized standards for measuring adverse maternal, birth and infant outcomes; (2) establishing surveillance centres of excellence in areas with high HIV prevalence with harmonized data collection and optimized electronic health records linking maternal/infant data; and (3) creating targets and evaluation goals for reporting progress on implementation and quality of surveillance in pregnancy. The platform will be leveraged to ensure that appropriate contributions and strategic actions by relevant stakeholders are implemented.},

Study Design: A prospective study was performed with 160 women who provided daily recordings of frequency, duration, and severity of nausea and vomiting. Results: Seventy-four percent of women reported nausea lasting a mean of 34.6 days. “Morning sickness” occurred in only 1.8\% of women, whereas 80\% reported nausea lasting all day. Only 50\% of women were relieved by 14 weeks’ gestation; 90\% had relief by week 22. Data based on the McGill Nausea Questionnaire indicate that the nausea experienced by pregnant women is similar in character and intensity to the nausea experienced by patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy. Conclusions: Traditional teachings about nausea and vomiting of pregnancy are contradicted by our findings. Standardized tools for measuring the distribution, duration, and intensity of nausea are applicable to the study of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and could be used in clinical trials to assess palliative measures.

However, the different methods can produce widely different estimates. An alternative way to understand the matter is to examine prevailing views of experts, thus capturing conventional wisdom on the topic in the face of the disparate approaches and estimates.

	abstract = {Objective
To provide a new approach to estimate optimal willingness to pay (WTP) for health technology assessment (HTA).
Study Design
This analysis specified utility as a function of income and calibrated it using estimates of relative risk aversion, from which the optimal WTP (K) can be determined using Garber and Phelps’ results (1997).
Methods
This analysis used the highly flexible Weibull utility function, calibrated with estimates of relative risk aversion (r*) derived from multiple data sources. The analysis centered on r* = 1 and conducted sensitivity analysis on r* and key Weibull parameters. For a range of income (M), graphs demonstrated how K/M and K vary with M. Results were compared with estimates of K and K/M from alternative models. Extrapolation from a representative individual to population-wide health plans was discussed.
Results
Using r* = 1 and central values of other key parameters, K/M (at average income for developed nations) was approximately 2× annual income. Both K and K/M rose with income. Sensitivity analysis showed that results depend moderately on the chosen value of r* and specific Weibull utility function parameters. At average income, the optimal K/M ratio (2×) was modestly lower than many standard recommendations (typically 3× average income) and substantially lower than estimates using value-of-statistical-life approaches.
Conclusions
The new model, although not yet perfected, provides a different way to identify the WTP cutoff for HTA. Extrapolation to more than twice the calibration income (\$50 000) is advised against. Analysis of other approaches to estimate the optimal K reveal potential upward biases.},

The mean number of days from last menstrual period to onset and cessation of symptoms was 39 and 84, respectively, and 40\% of women's symptoms ended abruptly. Cessation of symptoms occurred at approximately the same day from the last menstrual period whether they had begun early or later, severely or mildly [corrected]. The median total number of hours of nausea per pregnancy in those 292 women experiencing symptoms was 56, with peak symptoms occurring in the ninth week. Eighty five per cent of women experienced days with two episodes of nausea. Fifty three per cent of episodes of vomiting occurred between 06.00 hours and 12.00 hours. The symptom complex can be defined as episodic daytime pregnancy sickness. Among the study population, 206 women were in paid employment. Seventy three of these women (35\%) spent a mean of 62 hours away from their paid work because of symptoms of nausea and vomiting, showing the socioeconomic significance of this condition. The detailed information gathered should help in the investigation of the aetiology of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.},

We used data from an ongoing epidemiological study of pregnancies in four regional centres. Mothers of infants with congenital malformations ( n = 17 158) and a sample of normal infants ( n = 5329) were interviewed within 6 months of delivery by trained nurse-interviewers using a standardised questionnaire. For all risk factors investigated, odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated using multiple logistic regression, controlling for potential confounders. The cumulative incidence (risk) of NVP was 67\%. The risk of NVP and its timing during pregnancy were similar for mothers of malformed and normal infants, so data were combined. No changes in the NVP risk were observed over the 20-year study period. The risk decreased with increasing age, but increased with increasing gravidity. The risk also increased with increasing number of prior miscarriages. Further, within each gravidity category, the risk was higher for twin births than for singletons. Women who reported onset of NVP after the first trimester differed demographically from women whose NVP began earlier: they were less-well educated, had lower incomes, and were more likely to be black. The finding that the number of prior pregnancies, both complete and incomplete, and number of fetuses independently appear to increase the risk of NVP suggests a fetal ‘dose’ effect. Together with selected demographic characteristics that differentiate early- vs. late-onset NVP, these findings warrant further investigation.},

A recent review discussed some approximation methods for calculating the EVPPI, but as the research has been active over the intervening years, that review does not discuss some key estimation methods. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive review of these new methods. We begin by providing the technical details of these computation methods. We then present two case studies in order to compare the estimation performance of these new methods. We conclude that a method based on nonparametric regression offers the best method for calculating the EVPPI in terms of accuracy, computational time, and ease of implementation. This means that the EVPPI can now be used practically in health economic evaluations, especially as all the methods are developed in parallel with R functions and a web app to aid practitioners.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Pregnancy registries and spontaneous reports are essential pharmacovigilance tools to evaluate drug safety during pregnancy.

Objectives
The aim of this study was to evaluate postmarket capture of exposed pregnancies.

Methods
Pregnancy registries for drugs and biologics were identified in a systematic review. Through a standardized questionnaire, manufacturers provided information on (1) pregnancy registry enrollment and retention, and (2) worldwide receipt of spontaneous reports for exposed pregnancies. A validated algorithm for live-birth pregnancies allowed calculation of exposure rates per 100,000 live births using claims data.

Results
Among 34 products with a pregnancy registry, median (interquartile range) registry enrollment was 36 pregnancies (5–258) and median spontaneous report capture was 450 pregnancies (89–1192). Products used in {\textgreater}20/100,000 live births had a median registry enrollment of 490 pregnancies and median capture of 1061 spontaneously reported exposed pregnancies. Lower median registry enrollment and spontaneous report capture was observed for products used in 0.5–20/100,000 live births (36 from registries, 541 spontaneous reports) and {\textless}0.5/100,000 live births (3 from registries, 41 spontaneous reports). Among 24 registries enrolling ≥10 pregnancies, median capture of pregnancy outcomes (e.g. live birth, spontaneous abortion) was 83.9\%. For 19 registries enrolling ≥10 infants, the median proportion of infants achieving protocol-specified follow-up was 89.9\% for up to 4 weeks post-birth, 75.0\% for 1–5 months, and 57.1\% for ≥6 months.

Conclusions
Relatively higher product utilization among pregnant women predicted greater pregnancy registry enrollment. For products rarely used during pregnancy, registry enrollment was low and differences in registry enrollment compared with worldwide spontaneous report receipt were most pronounced. Products with very low utilization levels during pregnancy may require a combination of worldwide pharmacovigilance, pregnancy registries, and additional study methods to achieve adequate surveillance.},

Many are preventable with folic acid, and access to appropriate services for those affected can improve survival and quality of life. We used a compartmental model to estimate global and regional birth prevalence of NTDs (live births, stillbirths, and elective terminations of pregnancy) and subsequent under-5 mortality. Data were identified through web-based reviews of birth defect registry databases and systematic literature reviews. Meta-analyses were undertaken where appropriate. For 2015, our model estimated 260,100 (uncertainty interval (UI): 213,800–322,000) NTD-affected birth outcomes worldwide (prevalence 18.6 (15.3–23.0)/10,000 live births). Approximately 50\% of cases were elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomalies (UI: 59,300 (47,900–74,500)) or stillbirths (57,800 (UI: 35,000–88,600)). Of NTD-affected live births, 117,900 (∼75\%) (UI: 105,500–186,600) resulted in under-5 deaths. Our systematic review showed a paucity of high-quality data in the regions of the world with the highest burden. Despite knowledge about prevention, NTDs remain highly prevalent worldwide. Lack of surveillance and incomplete ascertainment of affected pregnancies make NTDs invisible to policy makers. Improved surveillance of all adverse outcomes is needed to improve the robustness of total NTD prevalence estimation, evaluate effectiveness of prevention through folic acid fortification, and improve outcomes through care and rehabilitation.},

Long-term trends in maternal mortality ratios (MMRs) for all states by racial and ethnic groups were estimated.To quantify trends in MMRs (maternal deaths per 100 000 live births) by state for 5 mutually exclusive racial and ethnic groups using a bayesian extension of the generalized linear model network.Observational study using vital registration and census data from 1999 to 2019 in the US. Pregnant or recently pregnant individuals aged 10 to 54 years were included.MMRs.In 2019, MMRs in most states were higher among American Indian and Alaska Native and Black populations than among Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander; Hispanic; and White populations. Between 1999 and 2019, observed median state MMRs increased from 14.0 (IQR, 5.7-23.9) to 49.2 (IQR, 14.4-88.0) among the American Indian and Alaska Native population, 26.7 (IQR, 18.3-32.9) to 55.4 (IQR, 31.6-74.5) among the Black population, 9.6 (IQR, 5.7-12.6) to 20.9 (IQR, 12.1-32.8) among the Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander population, 9.6 (IQR, 6.9-11.6) to 19.1 (IQR, 11.6-24.9) among the Hispanic population, and 9.4 (IQR, 7.4-11.4) to 26.3 (IQR, 20.3-33.3) among the White population. In each year between 1999 and 2019, the Black population had the highest median state MMR. The American Indian and Alaska Native population had the largest increases in median state MMRs between 1999 and 2019. Since 1999, the median of state MMRs has increased for all racial and ethnic groups in the US and the American Indian and Alaska Native; Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander; and Black populations each observed their highest median state MMRs in 2019.While maternal mortality remains unacceptably high among all racial and ethnic groups in the US, American Indian and Alaska Native and Black individuals are at increased risk, particularly in several states where these inequities had not been previously highlighted. Median state MMRs for the American Indian and Alaska Native and Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Other Pacific Islander populations continue to increase, even after the adoption of a pregnancy checkbox on death certificates. Median state MMR for the Black population remains the highest in the US. Comprehensive mortality surveillance for all states via vital registration identifies states and racial and ethnic groups with the greatest potential to improve maternal mortality. Maternal mortality persists as a source of worsening disparities in many US states and prevention efforts during this study period appear to have had a limited impact in addressing this health crisis.},

A questionnaire was mailed to 770 members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists who participate in the Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network. Results. The response rate was 58\%. Most respondents reported always asking pregnant patients about use of over-the-counter (OTC) (86\%) and prescription (98\%) drugs; 24\% reported not always asking about alternative medications. Far fewer reported always asking nonpregnant patients about use of alcohol (67\%), illegal drugs (51\%) and OTC medications (52\%) than pregnant patients. Two-fifths (41\%) reported prescribing a medication during pregnancy for which they had insufficient information about potential effects on the fetus; nearly half (47\%) reported that there are medical conditions for which they would like to prescribe medications but do not due to insufficient safety information. Physician responses indicate that they are less likely to refer pregnant than nonpregnant patients to a specialist for treatment of certain conditions. Conclusions. These results indicate that obstetrician-gynecologists sometimes prescribe medications for pregnant patients under less than optimal conditions and emphasize the importance of generating up-to-date information on effects of medications during pregnancy and having it readily available to health care providers.},

We sought to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed depression, treatment by modality, and treatment barriers by pregnancy status among U.S. reproductive-aged women.
Methods: We identified 375 pregnant and 8,657 nonpregnant women 18–44 years of age who met criteria for past-year major depressive episode (MDE) from 2005–2009 nationally representative data. Chi-square statistics and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) were calculated.
Results: MDE in pregnant women (65.9\%) went undiagnosed more often than in nonpregnant women (58.6\%) (aPR 1.1, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-1.3). Half of depressed pregnant (49.6\%) and nonpregnant (53.7\%) women received treatment (aPR 1.0, 95\% CI 0.90-1.1), with prescription medication the most common form for both pregnant (39.6\%) and nonpregnant (47.4\%) women. Treatment barriers did not differ by pregnancy status and were cost (54.8\%), opposition to treatment (41.7\%), and stigma (26.3\%).
Conclusions: Pregnant women with MDE were no more likely than nonpregnant women to be diagnosed with or treated for their depression.},

In order to inform research on safer medication use during pregnancy, we examined prescription medication use among women in the United States. We analyzed data from the 1999–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to estimate the prevalence of prescription medication use in the past 30 days among pregnant women and non-pregnant women of childbearing age (15–44 years) and to ascertain the most commonly reported prescription medications by women in these groups. We assessed how the most commonly reported medications differed among groups defined by selected demographic characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, and markers of socioeconomic status. Prescription medication use in the past 30 days was reported by 22 \% of pregnant women and 47 \% of non-pregnant women of childbearing age. The most commonly reported prescription medications by NHANES participants differed somewhat by pregnancy status; allergy and anti-infective medications were more common among pregnant women, while oral contraceptives were more common among non-pregnant women. Use of prescription medication for asthma and thyroid disorders was reported by both groups. Although prescription medication use in the previous 30 days was less common among pregnant women than non-pregnant women, its use was reported among almost 1 in 4 pregnant women. Many of the most common medications reported were for the treatment of chronic medical conditions. Given the potential impact of medications on the developing fetus, our data underscore the importance of understanding the safety of these medications during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Purpose To describe the utilization of drugs with pregnancy exposure registries by trimester during pregnancy, in comparison with matched nonpregnant episodes and a pre-pregnancy period. Methods We identified live-born deliveries from women aged 10 to 54 years and matched the pregnancies 1:1 with nonpregnant episodes from a comparator cohort not delivering live-born infants, using data from 2001 to 2013 in the Sentinel Distributed Database. We evaluated the utilization of 34 drugs with pregnancy exposure registries, comparing utilization during pregnancy to the matched nonpregnant episodes, and to the 90 days before pregnancy. Results We identified 1 895 597 pregnancies ending in live births in 1 598 697 women and 1 895 597 matched nonpregnant episodes in 1 582 581 women. We observed a lower prevalence of use for most drugs during pregnancy compared with the matched nonpregnant episodes, and the 90-day pre-pregnancy period. The median (interquartile range) prevalence ratio of use, at any time during pregnancy, for all products was 0.2 (0.1-0.3) comparing pregnant to nonpregnant episodes. Overall, there was a decrease in drug utilization by trimester; from 2.6\% in the 90 days preceding pregnancy to 2.1\% in the first trimester, 1.1\% in the second trimester, and 0.9\% in the third trimester. Conclusions Among drugs with pregnancy exposure registries, use was less during pregnancy compared with before pregnancy and to the matched nonpregnant episodes. The lower utilization during pregnancy suggests that women may be avoiding these drugs to minimize potentially harmful exposure during pregnancy. This lower utilization may increase the challenges of further studying the safety of these drugs using pregnancy exposure registries.},

COVID-19 case data (from 19 January 2020 to 10 January 2022) from a national database maintained by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency and the Central Disease Control Headquarters were analyzed. A joint Bayesian subnational model with partial pooling was used and yielded probability distribution models of key epidemiological distributions in Korea. Serial intervals from before and during the Delta variant’s predominance were estimated. Although the mean symptom-onset-to-report interval was 3.2 days at the national level, it varied across different regions (2.9–4.0 days). Gamma distribution showed the best fit for the onset-to-death interval (with heterogeneity in age, sex, and comorbidities) and the reporting-to-death interval. Log-normal distribution was optimal for ascertaining the onset-to-diagnosis and onset-to-report intervals. Serial interval (days) was shorter before the Delta variant-induced outbreaks than during the Delta variant’s predominance (4.4 vs. 5.2 days), indicating the higher transmission potential of the Delta variant. The identified heterogeneity in region-, age-, sex-, and period-based distributions of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 will facilitate the development of effective interventions and disease-control strategies.},

	abstract = {Understanding and monitoring the epidemiological time delay dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection provides insights that are key to discerning changes in the phenotype of the virus, the demographics impacted, the efficacy of treatment, and the ability of the health service to manage large volumes of patients. This paper analyses how the pandemic has evolved in the United Kingdom through the temporal changes to the epidemiological time delay distributions for clinical outcomes. Using the most complete clinical data presently available, we have analysed, through a doubly interval censored Bayesian modelling approach, the time from infection to a clinical outcome. Across the pandemic, for the periods that were defined as epidemiologically distinct, the modelled mean ranges from 8.0 to 9.7 days for infection to hospitalisation, 10.3 to 15.0 days for hospitalisation to death, and 17.4 to 24.7 days for infection to death. The time delay from infection to hospitalisation has increased since the first wave of the pandemic. A marked decrease was observed in the time from hospitalisation to death and infection to death at times of high incidence when hospitals and ICUs were under the most pressure. There is a clear relationship between age groups that is indicative of the youngest and oldest demographics having the shortest time delay distributions before a clinical outcome. A statistically significant difference was found between genders for the time delay from infection to hospitalisation, which was not found for hospitalisation to death. The results by age group indicate that younger demographics that require clinical intervention for SARS-CoV-2 infection are more likely to require earlier hospitalisation that leads to a shorter time to death, which is suggestive of the largely more vulnerable nature of these individuals that succumb to infection. The distinction found between genders for exposure to hospitalisation is revealing of gender healthcare seeking behaviours.},
